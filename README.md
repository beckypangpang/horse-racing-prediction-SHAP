# horse-racing-prediction-SHAP
This repository contains the code for machine learning models designed to predict the outcomes of horse races, with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) interpretation incorporated for enhanced model interpretability.The project utilizes a diverse set of features and employs state-of-the-art algorithms, including XGBoost and TabNet.

Key Features:
Dataset Exploration: Comprehensive exploration of the Hong Kong Horse Racing Dataset from Kaggle.
Model Construction: Development of multiple models, including a pre-trained TabNet model and an optimized XGBoost model.
Explainability: Interpretation of model predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), including variations like Kernel SHAP and Tree SHAP.
Local and Global Explainability: Analysis of individual predictions and exploration of global model behavior.
