# Horse Racing Outcome Prediction with SHAP Interpretation

This repository contains the code for machine learning models designed to predict the outcomes of horse races, with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) interpretation incorporated for enhanced model interpretability. The project utilizes a diverse set of features and employs state-of-the-art algorithms, including XGBoost and TabNet.
